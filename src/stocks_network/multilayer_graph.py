# Description

# The MultiLayerGraph class is designed to represent and manipulate multilayer networks,
# also known as multiplex networks. These networks consist of multiple layers, each 
# containing a single-layer network (graph), with nodes potentially connected across
# different layers. The class provides functionalities to create and modify multilayer
# graphs, add nodes and edges (both intra-layer and inter-layer), and compute various
# network metrics such as degree sequence, total degree sequence, modularity, and density.
